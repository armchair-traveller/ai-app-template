# AI App Template -- In Svelte!

> Yep, this is done. Original code ported from AI Hero repo.
> This branch covers required AND optional code. For non-optional code only, which is a mirror of 07-migrated-to-v5, see the `init` branch.

## TODO

Do related followup questions.

Handle anonymous requests to the API, rate limit by IP.

Use a chunking system on the crawled information.

Add 'edit' button, and 'rerun from here' button.

Add evals.

Handle conversations longer than the context window by summarizing.

How do you get the LLM to ask followup questions?

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
